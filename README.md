# Archived: node.zero (original monorepo)

This repository has been archived.

What began here as a single-file learning experiment has now evolved into a structured, multi-repo ecosystem under the [`env0.labs`](https://github.com/env0-labs) organization.

The work is ongoing, but it now lives in a modular form:

- [`env0.core`](https://github.com/env0-labs/env0.core) — the terminal simulation engine
- [`node.zero`](https://github.com/env0-labs/node.zero) — the command-line learning game
- [`entropy.echo`](https://github.com/env0-labs/entropy.echo) — a narrative horror experience
- [`env0.meta`](https://github.com/env0-labs/env0.meta) — planning docs and meta context

This repo remains available for historical context only.  
It is no longer being updated or maintained.
